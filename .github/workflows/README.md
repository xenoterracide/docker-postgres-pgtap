These containers just [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
with the [pgtap extension](https://pgtap.org/documentation.html) preinstalled, so you can refer to their documentation
on how to use it.

This container is meant for testing only, so it will not support the granularity of tags, and may fall up to a week
behind the official postgres docker container.

Feel free to open a bug or pull request though if a new major version of postgres needs to be supported.
